# Exploring Main Topics in Student Course Reviews at Waterloo University

## Contents
1. DATA folder: Contains course_data_clean.csv, a cleaned version of our dataset, and stopwords copy.txt, which lists the stopwords used for topic modeling.
2. SCRIPTS folder: Includes DS 4002 Project 1.ipynb, which holds all the source code for data loading, cleaning, and topic modeling.
3. OUTPUT folder: Contains plots generated during the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset.

## Software and platform
For the project, we used Python and the additional operator, joblib, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib libraries. Each of our group members used Mac platforms.

## Map of Documentation
In the DATA folder, there is course_data_clean.csv, which is a cleaned CSV file of our dataset. There is also stopwords copy.txt, which contains all the stopwords we used for topic modeling. In the SCRIPTS folder, there is DS 4002 Project 1.ipynb, which includes all of our source code for loading and cleaning the data, as well as topic modeling. In the OUTPUT folder, there are plots that were produced from initial EDA of our dataset.


## Instructions for reproducing results
To reproduce the results of this study, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Navigate to Google Colab and sign in with your Google account.
2. In the Colab interface, click on File in the top navigation bar, then select Open Notebook.
3. In the popup titled "Open Notebook," find the left-hand navigation bar and click on the GitHub tab.
4. In the search bar, enter the username RainaVardhan. In the Repository field, select RainaVardhan/DS4002-Project-1.
5. Open the file located at SCRIPTS/DS_PROJECT_1.ipynb.
6. After the file opens, go to Runtime in the menu and select Run all to execute all the cells. This will run the entire analysis process, including data preprocessing, model building, and result generation.
7. The notebook contains sections for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Review the outputs, plots, and performance metrics generated. You can also modify or rerun specific cells to test different models or parameters.
8.  Once the notebook finishes running, save the results (such as plots and metrics) by downloading them locally or saving them to your Google Drive.
